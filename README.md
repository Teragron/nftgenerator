# NFT - Generator
This Application helps you create NFT with a simple python script.

## What is NFT Generator ?
Combining and overlaying image datas on top of each other from 4 categories. The categories can vary from background to body-parts. In the following parts of the README.md i will generally refer the category as body-parts. 



## Demo
[![Watch the video](https://i.imgflip.com/604ad4.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeLu6wteRGI)

This demo is a demonstration for the NFT project "ANANASMAN", which showcases the combination of 3 body-parts and 1 background category. The GUI usage is quite simple as it can be seen from the demo video.

## Running the Script

The Application has (yet) no executable file, so running it directly from terminal or jupyter notebook (DEMO) is what i would recommend.


## How to prepare the necessary data?

The most vital data is the body-part data, which has (for now) 4 sub paths.

The body-part paths and "generated2" path  should exist in following directorial tree way:
